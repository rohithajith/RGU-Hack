## TL;DR: 
Utilizing 'output_datasetAK47.csv' as the input, the 'codebook.ipynb' notebook using the 'output_datasetAK47.csv' executes a machine learning pipeline to train a predictive model. The workflow involves preprocessing the data, training a RandomForestRegressor, and outputting predictions. This process aims to predict car prices based on features derived from the dataset, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency. Results aid in identifying vehicles that offer the best value over a specified ownership period, considering factors such as mileage, maintenance, and fuel costs.
